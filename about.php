					<p>I focused on front-end development by restructuring the CSS for modularity and consistency across the site.
						I also designed the database structure and integrated the base game with online technologies to enable multiplayer functionality.
						Additionally, I helped flesh out Wilsonâ€™s original idea by refining the user interface and ensuring it was responsive and user-friendly.
